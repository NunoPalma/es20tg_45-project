### Listed features

Below, we list **only** the implemented features. For each feature, we link the relevant files and we mark which requested parts are completed.

#### Feature number 4: _An approved question can become part of the set of available questions_

 - When a teacher goes to evaluate a question, he now has 2 options. Either he clicks on *Saves and Approves* which will make the question
 become a part of the set of *AVAILABLE* questions or he clicks on *Skip and Approve* which will approve a question but will become *DISABLED*.
 This is done on the frontend, on a new updated version of the EvaluateQuestionDialog using the same services of the last deliveries.
 It can be checked here:
 - [x] [Updated EvaluateQuestionDialog.vue](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_45-project/blob/perguntas-por-alunos-dev/frontend/src/views/teacher/evaluations/EvaluateQuestionDialog.vue)
 - [x] [Cypress use case test](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_45-project/blob/perguntas-por-alunos-dev/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/teacher/teacherSubmitEvaluation.js)
   + Screenshot:

#### Feature number 5: _A teacher can change an approved question before putting it as part of the set of available questions_

 - In this feature, it was all done in frontend as well, while using methods and services that already existed. When a teacher, 
 while evaluating a question, clicks *Skip and Approve*, he basically approves the question but, while being *DISABLED*, the teacher
 can then edit the question at his will and then change it's status to *AVAILABLE* with the existing methods/services.
 We thought that this implementation would be much better in terms of work flow and more natural. It's all in the *Updated 
 EvaluateQuestionDialog.vue* of the above feature.
