#### Discussion of findings

The Service sortStudentSubmittedQuestions used to be a user service that invoked a question service. 
Now it is all aggregatted within Question Service. SubmitEvaluationService used to receive too many parameteres (a boolean for the approval and a string for the justification), now it receives an EvaluationDto instead where it can find that information.

#### Discussion of findings

We reached the conclusion that the database, more specifically its service, Hibernate, is responsible for the consumption of most resources.
However, due to the convenience Hibernate gives us, it's not recommended to do any optimization related to Hibernate.
